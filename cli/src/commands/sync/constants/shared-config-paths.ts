/**
 * Tool outputs that rulesync merges into rather than fully owns (user-managed
 * settings files), as paths relative to the output root. Most come straight from
 * a tool's default `getSettablePaths`; the rest are twins a generator only
 * chooses at write time or under non-default options: `.amp/settings.jsonc`
 * (runtime probe twin of `.amp/settings.json`), `opencode.jsonc` / `kilo.jsonc`
 * (preferred over the `.json` twin when neither file exists yet), and
 * `.claude/settings.local.json` (claudecode ignore `fileMode: "local"`).
 *
 * Two behaviors are derived from this single list:
 *
 * - They are deliberately **not** gitignored (`DERIVED_PATHS_NOT_GITIGNORED` in
 *   `src/cli/commands/gitignore-derive.ts`), because a user may hand-author
 *   settings in them that should stay version-controlled.
 * - Because they are committable, rulesync must not **create** one just to hold
 *   an empty payload — that would be pure `git status` noise. See
 *   `AiFile#shouldSkipCreationWhenPayloadEmpty()`.
 *
 * Paths are stored without the leading "**" glob prefix; the gitignore
 * derivation adds it.
